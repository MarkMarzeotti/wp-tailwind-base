# Someone Build This

A website promoting extreme collaboration.

People could post ideas of things. They could be an opportunity theyâ€™ve seen in a market they are a part of or just an idea of something they think could work. People could comment on them and upvote them if they like the idea or they think it could work.

Once the idea is out it belongs to the community. The person who had it can continue to be involved or not. Multiple people could take the idea any way they wanted in the form of a comment. This may be very reddit esque in nature to surface popular ideas. 

Anyone who wanted to build or design the idea for any reason could do so. They could use them for portfolio pieces. They could publish it to the community and again go through comments and upvoting. Someone could come along and build it. In any capacity and post it. Multiple people could build it for their own reasons. They could keep their build private or in their portfolio. Everything was GPL once published.

People do social media redesigns and publish them. People build clones of different apps in the latest technology. The talent is there. If we could find the right people to collaborate with, maybe on a project that means something to us. With as much pressure as They'd like to put on themselves. Maybe they finish it and publish it. Maybe they were just trying something new, maybe they lost interest. Whatever. If its great, someone else can build it. They can even pick up where you left off if they like.

Challenge people to finish things but make milestones small. Like little challenges.

Maybe there is no profile like Reddit to promote collaboration without prejudice. You can truly be anyone if thats what youd like. Or you can link to your profile.

What if there were no links out. You had to type it out? Or if each post was only allowed one URL... Its maybe a little extreme. Don't want to put too many limitations on it either. 

Allow Ideas. Text based ideas. No picture messaging. Maybe limited emojis.

If you are well along in your career and make a living off your work and would never do what you do for free, then we respect that and welcome you browse what we have going on for as long as you like. We are about extreme collaboration and whatever comes out of it.

The site would remove any post requesting a bid. This is not a job site. This site would remove posts listing their skills and hourly rates. This site is not a business directory.

We will not remove any conversation about an idea that is contructive. Constructive does not mean positive. Constructive means contributing to the conversation either for or against an idea. People may agree with you. They also might not. 

This is a collaborative environment. Sharing something should come from external links. They can be anything. A designer might share a link to a Dribbble project, or an invision document, or a png on Imgur. A developer might share a Gist, a github repo or a Codepen, or a link to a working hosted version.

Hopefully some of these things could be centered around good and helping one another. The ideas here dont need to be software. They could be an issue they have an idea on how to solve.

People could share youtube links.

Spam and things not contributing to the conversation can be downvoted and things contributing to the convo can be upvoted. Words of motivation are encouraged and pointing out flaws (constructive criticism) is also encouraged.

Make build show critique

Use for whatever you like.

Maybe things cant be deleted except by us. You can deactivate the profile and your name will be changed.
